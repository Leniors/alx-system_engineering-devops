ntroduction:
Understanding the intricacies of what happens behind the scenes when we type a simple URL into our browser and hit enter can be a fascinating journey into the depths of the internet's infrastructure. From DNS resolution to database queries, each step plays a crucial role in delivering the web page to our screen. In this blog post, we'll break down the process of what happens when we type "https://www.google.com" into our browser and press Enter, exploring concepts such as DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.
DNS Request:
The journey begins with the Domain Name System (DNS) resolving the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. Our browser sends a DNS request to the configured DNS resolver (typically provided by the ISP or a third-party DNS service like Google DNS). The resolver then queries the DNS hierarchy, starting from the root DNS servers, to find the authoritative DNS server responsible for the google.com domain. Once found, the resolver retrieves the corresponding IP address and returns it to the browser.
TCP/IP:
With the IP address in hand, the browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the web server hosting Google's content. TCP ensures reliable communication by establishing a connection-oriented session between the client (browser) and the server. This involves a three-way handshake where SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets are exchanged to establish the connection.
Firewall:
During the TCP handshake, the request passes through any network firewalls, which are responsible for enforcing security policies. Firewalls examine incoming and outgoing traffic, filtering based on predefined rules to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
HTTPS/SSL:
Once the TCP connection is established, if the URL begins with "https://" (as in the case of "https://www.google.com"), it indicates that the browser will use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS). This encryption ensures that the information exchanged, including sensitive data like login credentials or personal information, remains secure from eavesdroppers and tampering.
Load Balancer:
In the case of large-scale websites like Google, requests are often distributed across multiple servers to ensure high availability and optimal performance. Load balancers sit between the client and the web servers, distributing incoming requests across a pool of servers based on predefined algorithms (such as round-robin or least connections). This ensures even distribution of traffic, prevents server overload, and improves fault tolerance.
Web Server:
Upon receiving the HTTPS request, one of Google's web servers processes the request. Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS are responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing dynamic content, and generating responses. In the case of Google, sophisticated web server infrastructure efficiently serves millions of requests per second.
Application Server:
For dynamic content or interactive features (such as search queries), the web server may interact with an application server. Application servers execute server-side logic, interact with databases, and generate dynamic content in response to client requests. Google's application servers handle complex operations, such as processing search queries or serving personalized content based on user preferences.
Database:
In many cases, web applications rely on databases to store and retrieve data. When a request requires accessing or modifying data, the application server communicates with the database server. Google, with its vast array of services and applications, likely utilizes a sophisticated database infrastructure to manage the immense volume of data generated by its users, powering services like Google Search, Gmail, and Google Drive.
